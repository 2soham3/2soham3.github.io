January 2023 - April-2023

Studied in particular the proof, ' If S is a compact surface with finitely many marked points, then the group Mod(S) is finitely presented', from the book 'A Primer on Mapping Class Group' by Benson Farb and Dan Margalit. 

### Dehn Twists and Generating the Mapping Class Group(Semester Project) Guide: [Dr. Chitrabhanu Chaudhuri](http://www.niser.ac.in/~chitrabhanu/), NISER, Bhubaneswar
